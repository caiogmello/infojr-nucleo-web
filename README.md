# üíª N√∫cleo Web

This is the N√∫cleo Web: Some of the web development projects that I [(@caiogmello)](https://github.com/caiogmello) did during the [InfoJr](https://infojr.com.br/) Trainee process.

- Here you will find **front** and **back-end** projects, **JavaScript** ecosystem based.

Each of this folders is a project, which has its own README.md and instructions to running it. 

- **Feel comfortable to check-up any project and try in your computer.**  üòâ
